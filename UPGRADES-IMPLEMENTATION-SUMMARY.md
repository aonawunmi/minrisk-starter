# MinRisk Upgrades Implementation Summary

## Version 4.5 - Two Major Upgrades

This document summarizes the implementation of two significant upgrades to the MinRisk application:

1. **UPGRADE 1**: Control Enhancement Plans (Minor)
2. **UPGRADE 2**: Risk Intelligence Monitor (Significant)

---

## UPGRADE 1: Control Enhancement Plans

### Purpose
Persist AI Control Adequacy Assessment recommendations so they're not lost when the window closes. Enables tracking, review, and implementation of control improvements.

### What Was Built

#### Database Schema
**File**: `control-enhancement-plans-schema.sql`
- **Table**: `control_enhancement_plans`
  - Stores assessment snapshots
  - JSONB for flexible recommendation storage
  - Tracks overall adequacy score (0-10)
  - Links to incident and captures risk snapshots
  - Status tracking: pending, partially_accepted, fully_accepted, rejected
- **RLS Policies**: Users see own plans, Admins see all
- **Triggers**: Auto-update timestamps

#### Backend (TypeScript)
**File**: `src/lib/controlEnhancements.ts`
- `saveEnhancementPlan()` - Save new assessment
- `loadEnhancementPlans()` - Load plans for incident
- `updateRecommendationStatus()` - Accept/reject individual recommendations
- `acceptAllRecommendations()` - Bulk accept
- `rejectAllRecommendations()` - Bulk reject
- `markRecommendationImplemented()` - Mark as implemented
- `getEnhancementPlansStatistics()` - Organization-wide stats

#### Frontend Components

**`src/components/incidents/EnhancementPlanHistory.tsx`**

## Support and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Enhancement Plans not saving:**
- Check Supabase logs for errors
- Verify user has organization_id in profile
- Check RLS policies are active

**News Scanner errors:**
- Check RSS feed URLs are accessible
- Verify timeout (10s) is sufficient
- Check network connectivity
- Review error logs in console

**Intelligence Alerts not appearing:**
- Verify scanner ran successfully
- Check events were stored (query `external_events` table)
- Verify confidence threshold (0.6 minimum)
- Check category mapping (some combinations filtered)

**Likelihood not updating on accept:**
- Verify "Apply to risk" checkbox was checked
- Check risk exists and is not read-only
- Review Supabase logs

### Database Queries for Debugging

```sql
-- Check enhancement plans
SELECT * FROM control_enhancement_plans ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Check external events
SELECT * FROM external_events ORDER BY published_date DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Check intelligence alerts
SELECT * FROM risk_intelligence_alerts ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Check alert statistics
SELECT status, COUNT(*) FROM risk_intelligence_alerts GROUP BY status;

-- Check risks with alerts
SELECT risk_code, active_alerts_count FROM risks WHERE active_alerts_count > 0;
```
