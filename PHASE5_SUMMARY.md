## Questions for Discussion

1. **Priority:** Do you want to pursue full ISO 31000 certification, or implement high-priority features only?

2. **Timeline:** Do you prefer sequential (slower, lower risk) or parallel (faster, higher complexity) implementation?

3. **Budget:** Is the $63,000-115,000 investment aligned with current budget constraints?

4. **Resources:** Do you have internal developers available, or should we plan for external contractors?

5. **Phasing:** Should we implement all 6 features, or start with Priority 1-2 and evaluate?

6. **Customization:** Are there organization-specific requirements not covered in the standard features?
