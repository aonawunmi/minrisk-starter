## 🔲 Remaining Tasks

### 1. Transfer Risks to Another User (Optional Feature)
**Priority:** Medium
**Status:** Not started

**Description:**
When deleting a user, provide admin with option to transfer their risks to another user instead of archiving them.

**Current behavior:**
User deletion always archives all their risks

**Requested behavior:**
Give admin choice in delete dialog:
- Option 1: "Archive all risks" (current default)
- Option 2: "Transfer to another user" (new option)
  - Show dropdown to select target user
  - Transfer all risks and controls to selected user
  - Log the transfer in audit trail

**Implementation notes:**
- Update UserManagement.tsx delete dialog
- Add user selection dropdown
- Update delete_user() function to support transfer option
- Add audit logging for transfer action

---

### 2. Migration Tool for Remapping Risk Scores
**Priority:** Low
**Status:** Not started

**Description:**
Provide a tool to help admin remap risk score values when changing matrix size.

**What exists:**
System blocks 6×6 to 5×5 change if any risks use level 6

**What's missing:**
A tool to bulk-remap level 6 values to level 5:
- Example: "All likelihood=6 become likelihood=5"
- Example: "All impact=6 become impact=5"
- Show preview of affected risks before applying
- Log all changes in audit trail

**Implementation notes:**
- Create new "Migration Tool" component in Configuration
- Show when matrix size change is blocked
- Display list of affected risks
- Provide mapping options (e.g., 6→5, 6→4, etc.)
- Preview changes before applying
- Batch update with transaction
- Log to audit trail

**Alternative approach:**
Instead of a migration tool, keep current behavior of requiring manual archive of affected risks before allowing matrix size change.

### 3. Add "Commit" Button for Risk Managers
**Priority:** Medium
**Status:** Not started

**Description:**
Implement a "Commit" button in the risk register interface for risk managers to explicitly save and log their changes.

**Implementation details:**
- Add "Commit" button when creating/updating/deleting risks
- Button triggers save-and-log event
- Record every commit in audit trail with timestamp
- Provide visual feedback on successful commit

**Implementation notes:**
- Add commit button to RiskDialog component
- Update risk creation/update flow to include commit action
- Ensure all commits are logged to audit trail with proper metadata
- Show confirmation toast on successful commit
