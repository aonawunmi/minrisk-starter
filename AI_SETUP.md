## How It Works

### Context-Rich Prompts

The AI generates risks based on:

1. **Your Input Context**:
   - Industry type (e.g., "Banking")
   - Business unit (e.g., "Trading Desk")
   - Risk category (e.g., "Operational")
   - Additional context you provide

2. **Claude's Training Data** (up to January 2025):
   - Industry standards (ISO 31000, COSO ERM, Basel III)
   - Regulatory frameworks (SEC, MiFID II, Dodd-Frank)
   - Published risk assessments and case studies
   - Best practices from thousands of organizations

3. **Your Existing Risks** (optional enhancement):
   - Can be configured to analyze your current risk register
   - Suggests risks you might have missed
   - Avoids duplicating existing entries

### What Claude CANNOT Do

- ‚ùå Access real-time market data
- ‚ùå Search your internal documents (unless you provide them)
- ‚ùå Know your specific institution's risk history
- ‚ùå Access external databases or APIs
- ‚ùå Browse the internet

## Security Notes

- API keys are sensitive - never commit `.env` files to version control

- API calls are made directly from the browser (client-side)
- For production, consider implementing a backend proxy to hide API keys
- Monitor API usage regularly to prevent unexpected costs
