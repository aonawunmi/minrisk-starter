## Best Practices

### Risk Management

1. **Consistent Risk Codes**
   - Use a naming convention: "R001", "R002", etc.
   - Or category-based: "FIN-001", "OPS-001"
   - Document your convention

2. **Regular Updates**
   - Review risks quarterly minimum
   - Update status as risks progress
   - Add new controls as they're implemented

3. **Control Effectiveness**
   - Be honest in control ratings
   - Document reasons for low scores
   - Track improvements over time

4. **Priority Focus**
   - Use priority selection for executive reporting
   - Focus on high-risk items first
   - Review priorities monthly

### Configuration Management

1. **Plan Before Changing**
   - Understand impact of configuration changes
   - Communicate changes to team
   - Archive or modify affected risks first

2. **Consistent Categories**
   - Align with industry standards
   - Keep categories broad enough to be useful
   - Avoid too many categories (max 10-12)

3. **Matrix Size**
   - Start with 5√ó5 (simpler)
   - Move to 6√ó6 only if needed for granularity
   - Don't change frequently

### Admin Operations

1. **User Approval**
   - Verify user identity before approving
   - Start with View Only for new users
   - Upgrade based on demonstrated need

2. **Archive Management**
   - Keep archives for compliance period
   - Don't permanently delete without reason
   - Document reason when deleting

3. **Audit Trail**
   - Review regularly for suspicious activity
   - Export for compliance reporting
   - Train team on proper usage

### Data Quality

1. **Complete Information**
   - Fill all required fields
   - Provide meaningful descriptions
   - Assign clear ownership

2. **Regular Cleanup**
   - Close risks that are no longer relevant
   - Archive outdated risks
   - Remove duplicate entries

3. **Training**
   - Train all users on proper usage
   - Document your organization's conventions
   - Regular refresher sessions

## Troubleshooting

### Login Issues

**Problem**: Can't log in after signup
- **Solution**: Wait for admin approval. Contact your admin if pending too long.

**Problem**: Forgot password
- **Solution**: Use "Forgot password?" link on login screen.

### Permission Issues

**Problem**: Can't add/edit risks
- **Solution**: Your role is View Only. Request admin to upgrade your role.

**Problem**: Can't access configuration
- **Solution**: Only admins can access configuration.

### Data Issues

**Problem**: Risk code already exists
- **Solution**: Risk codes must be unique per user. Try a different code.

**Problem**: Can't delete risk
- **Solution**: Edit users must request deletion (admin approval required).

**Problem**: Can't change matrix from 6√ó6 to 5√ó5
- **Solution**: Archive or modify risks that use level 6 first.

### Performance Issues

**Problem**: Application slow with many risks
- **Solution**: Use filters to reduce displayed data. Close old risks.

**Problem**: Heatmap not loading
- **Solution**: Reduce priority selection. Try refreshing the page.

## Appendix

### Risk Score Calculation

**Inherent Risk Score:**
```
Score = Likelihood (Inherent) √ó Impact (Inherent)
```

**Residual Risk Score:**
```
Control Effectiveness = Average of (Design + Implementation + Monitoring + Effectiveness Evaluation) / 4

If Control targets Likelihood:
  Residual Likelihood = Inherent Likelihood - (Control Effectiveness / 2)

If Control targets Impact:
  Residual Impact = Inherent Impact - (Control Effectiveness / 2)

Residual Score = Residual Likelihood √ó Residual Impact
```

### Risk Matrix Reference

**5√ó5 Matrix:**
- Low: 1-6 (Green)
- Medium: 8-12 (Yellow)
- High: 15-20 (Orange)
- Very High: 25 (Red)

**6√ó6 Matrix:**
- Low: 1-9 (Green)
- Medium: 12-18 (Yellow)
- High: 20-30 (Orange)
- Very High: 36 (Red)

### Data Export Format

When exporting data (future feature):
- **CSV**: Comma-separated values
- **Excel**: .xlsx format
- **PDF**: For reporting
