- **Description**: What the control does
- **Target**: Whether it reduces Likelihood or Impact
- **Rationale**: Why this control is effective
- **Implementation Tips**: How to implement

**Example Output:**
```
Risk: Cybersecurity Breach (TECH-011)

Recommended Controls:

1. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
   Target: Likelihood
   Rationale: Prevents unauthorized access even if passwords
   are compromised
   Implementation: Deploy MFA for all user accounts, starting
   with admin and privileged users

2. Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
   Target: Impact
   Rationale: Enables rapid detection and response to reduce
   breach impact
   Implementation: Implement SIEM solution with 24/7 monitoring
   and automated alerting

3. Regular Vulnerability Scanning
   Target: Likelihood
   Rationale: Identifies and remediates vulnerabilities before
   exploitation
   Implementation: Weekly automated scans, monthly manual
   assessments, patch within 30 days
```

#### Adding Suggested Controls

1. **Review** each suggested control
2. **Click "Add Control"** button next to the suggestion
3. Control is automatically added with:
   - Description pre-filled
   - Target (Likelihood/Impact) set
   - Initial DIME scores (you should review and adjust)

4. **Adjust DIME scores** based on your actual implementation

#### Rating Controls (DIME Framework)

For each control, rate 1-5 on four dimensions:

**Design (D):**
- How well is the control designed?
- Does it address the root cause?
- Is it appropriate for the risk level?

**Implementation (I):**
- How well is it implemented?
- Is it fully operational?
- Are there gaps in coverage?

**Monitoring (M):**
- How well is it monitored?
- Are violations detected promptly?
- Is there regular oversight?

**Effectiveness Evaluation (E):**
- Overall effectiveness assessment
- Does it achieve intended results?
- Evidence of risk reduction?

**Rating Scale:**
- **5 - Fully Effective**: Control operates as designed, fully implemented
- **4 - Substantially Effective**: Minor gaps, mostly effective
- **3 - Moderately Effective**: Some gaps, partially effective
- **2 - Partially Effective**: Significant gaps, limited effectiveness
- **1 - Not Effective**: Control not working or not implemented

#### Control Effectiveness Calculation

**For each control:**
```
Average DIME = (D + I + M + E) / 4
```

**Impact on residual risk:**
```
If control targets Likelihood:
  Residual Likelihood = Inherent Likelihood - (Avg DIME / 2)

If control targets Impact:
  Residual Impact = Inherent Impact - (Avg DIME / 2)
```

**Multiple controls** compound the effect.

#### Best Practices for Controls

**1. Balance Likelihood and Impact Controls**
- Don't focus only on one dimension
- Some risks need both types
- Consider cost-benefit

**2. Be Honest in DIME Ratings**
- Accurate ratings drive better decisions
- Low scores highlight improvement areas
- Re-rate after enhancements

**3. Document Implementation**
- Note specific tools/processes used
- Document monitoring procedures
- Track effectiveness evidence

**4. Regular Review**
- Review DIME scores quarterly
- Update after control changes
- Re-run AI suggestions if risk changes

## Best Practices

### Risk Management

1. **Consistent Risk Codes**
   - Use a naming convention: "R001", "R002", etc.
   - Or category-based: "FIN-001", "OPS-001"
   - Document your convention

2. **Regular Updates**
   - Review risks quarterly minimum
   - Update status as risks progress
   - Add new controls as they're implemented

3. **Control Effectiveness**
   - Be honest in control ratings
   - Document reasons for low scores
   - Track improvements over time

4. **Priority Focus**
   - Use priority selection for executive reporting
   - Focus on high-risk items first
   - Review priorities monthly

### Configuration Management

1. **Plan Before Changing**
   - Understand impact of configuration changes
   - Communicate changes to team
   - Archive or modify affected risks first

2. **Consistent Categories**
   - Align with industry standards
   - Keep categories broad enough to be useful
   - Avoid too many categories (max 10-12)

3. **Matrix Size**
   - Start with 5√ó5 (simpler)
   - Move to 6√ó6 only if needed for granularity
   - Don't change frequently

### Admin Operations

1. **User Approval**
   - Verify user identity before approving
   - Start with View Only for new users
   - Upgrade based on demonstrated need

2. **Archive Management**
   - Keep archives for compliance period
   - Don't permanently delete without reason
   - Document reason when deleting

3. **Audit Trail**
   - Review regularly for suspicious activity
   - Export for compliance reporting
   - Train team on proper usage

### Data Quality

1. **Complete Information**
   - Fill all required fields
   - Provide meaningful descriptions
   - Assign clear ownership

2. **Regular Cleanup**
   - Close risks that are no longer relevant
   - Archive outdated risks
   - Remove duplicate entries

3. **Training**
   - Train all users on proper usage
   - Document your organization's conventions
   - Regular refresher sessions

## Troubleshooting

### Login Issues

**Problem**: Can't log in after signup
- **Solution**: Wait for admin approval. Contact your admin if pending too long.

**Problem**: Forgot password
- **Solution**: Use "Forgot password?" link on login screen.

### Permission Issues

**Problem**: Can't add/edit risks
- **Solution**: Your role is View Only. Request admin to upgrade your role.

**Problem**: Can't access configuration
- **Solution**: Only admins can access configuration.

### Data Issues

**Problem**: Risk code already exists
- **Solution**: Risk codes must be unique per user. Try a different code.

**Problem**: Can't delete risk
- **Solution**: Edit users must request deletion (admin approval required).

**Problem**: Can't change matrix from 6√ó6 to 5√ó5
- **Solution**: Archive or modify risks that use level 6 first.

### Performance Issues

**Problem**: Application slow with many risks
- **Solution**: Use filters to reduce displayed data. Close old risks.

**Problem**: Heatmap not loading
- **Solution**: Reduce priority selection. Try refreshing the page.

## Appendix

### Risk Score Calculation

**Inherent Risk Score:**
```
Score = Likelihood (Inherent) √ó Impact (Inherent)
```

**Residual Risk Score:**
```
Control Effectiveness = Average of (Design + Implementation + Monitoring + Effectiveness Evaluation) / 4

If Control targets Likelihood:
  Residual Likelihood = Inherent Likelihood - (Control Effectiveness / 2)

If Control targets Impact:
  Residual Impact = Inherent Impact - (Control Effectiveness / 2)

Residual Score = Residual Likelihood √ó Residual Impact
```

### Risk Matrix Reference

**5√ó5 Matrix:**
- Low: 1-6 (Green)
- Medium: 8-12 (Yellow)
- High: 15-20 (Orange)
- Very High: 25 (Red)

**6√ó6 Matrix:**
- Low: 1-9 (Green)
- Medium: 12-18 (Yellow)
- High: 20-30 (Orange)
- Very High: 36 (Red)

### Data Export Format

When exporting data (future feature):
- **CSV**: Comma-separated values
- **Excel**: .xlsx format
- **PDF**: For reporting
